Practice HTML and Git commits

3/23/2023

This will be my first Github entry. The goal was to practice many HTML commands while putting together a rudimentary website. I used hyperlinks, different heading options, ordered/unordered lists and images for this fake recipe repository.

To save time and effort, I made the ingredients/steps short and most definitely inaccurate. Hopefully a bit of humor will make up for the terrible meals these recipes would lead to.

I found the practice for traversing project directories and files from the editor useful. I will commit to Github, then return and add a link at the end of each recipe to travel back to the main page for robustness and Git practice.
